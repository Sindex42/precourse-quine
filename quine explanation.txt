Line by line explanation

  puts <<2*2,2
  puts <<2*2,2
  2

# 1st line

puts <<2
=> puts everything up until the character "2"
.. *2
=> puts it twice
.. ,2
=> then puts "2"

# 2nd Line

puts <<2*2,2
=> This is after the "puts<<2" line and is therefore a string.
   It is an exact copy of our code that is going to be executed (1st line).
   And due to the "*2" in the 1st line, it is going to be puts'ed twice,
    which gives us an output of:

   puts <<2*2,2
   puts <<2*2,2

# 3rd Line

2
=> The first 2 in the 1st line is this 2, it signifies the end of what "puts" needs to puts.
   The last 2 in the 1st line is the one that is printed to the console to give us the final output:

   puts <<2*2,2
   puts <<2*2,2
   2

   Which is the source code in its entirety.
